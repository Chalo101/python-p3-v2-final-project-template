Creating a comprehensive README.md is crucial for any project as it serves as a guide for users and collaborators. Below is a template for a README.md file tailored to a project with a CLI script managing books and authors using SQLAlchemy and Python.

# Book Management CLI Application

This Python CLI application allows users to manage a collection of books and their authors. It leverages SQLAlchemy for database management and provides functionalities to add new books, view existing books, search books by title, author, or genre, and delete books from the database.

## Getting Started

To use this application, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. Clone this repository to your local machine and set up the database using SQLite or another supported database management system.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite (or another supported RDBMS)

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the CLI application by executing `python lib/cli.py` from the command line. Follow the prompts to perform various operations:

```bash
python lib/cli.py
```

### Functionality

#### Adding a New Book

Allows users to add a new book by entering the title, genre, and author's name. If the author doesn't exist in the database, they are added automatically.

#### Viewing Existing Books

Displays a list of all existing books in the database, showing the title, genre, and author for each book.

#### Searching for Books

Enables users to search for books by title, author, or genre. Displays search results matching the provided keyword.

#### Deleting a Book

Allows users to delete a book by entering its title. Prompts for confirmation before deleting the book from the database.

#### Exiting the Program

Exits the CLI application gracefully.

## Files and Functions

### `cli.py`

The main CLI script (`cli.py`) contains the following functions:

- **`main()`**: Controls the main menu loop and user interaction.
- **`menu()`**: Displays the menu options for the user to choose from.
- **`add_book()`**: Prompts the user to add a new book to the database.
- **`view_books()`**: Displays all existing books in the database.
- **`search_books()`**: Allows users to search for books by title, author, or genre.
- **`delete_book()`**: Prompts the user to delete a book from the database.
- **`exit_program()`**: Exits the CLI application.

### Models (`author.py` and `book.py`)

#### `author.py`

Defines the `Author` model class with the following attributes and methods:

- **Attributes**: `id`, `name`
- **ORM Methods**: `create`, `delete`, `get_all`, `find_by_id`

#### `book.py`

Defines the `Book` model class with the following attributes and methods:

- **Attributes**: `id`, `title`, `genre`, `author_id`
- **ORM Methods**: `create`, `delete`, `get_all`, `find_by_id`
